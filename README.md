# Speech Recognition

### This is an assignment of my MBA in Artificial Intelligence.
### This is a simple program that uses the library speech_recognition from python to capture the audio from your microphone and converting to text.
### From this text was implemented a simple calculator that acepts sum and subtraction only.
### The requirements from this project was:
- Create a program that can listen to your voice and write what it listen
- Use this program to create a calculator
- If a person says "one plus two" it should recognize the numbers and operation and return "1 + 1 = 2"
- If a person says "three minus two" it should recognize the numbers and operation and return "3 - 2 = 1"
- It should work only for sum and subtraction
- If the operation division or multiplication is informed it should return a string saying it only works with sum and subtraction
- If a diferent entry is informed it should say that is and invalid entry
